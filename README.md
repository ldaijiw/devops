# DevOps

## Why DevOps - Benefits to the Business

Technical benefits
- Continuous software delivery
- Less complexity to manage
- Faster resolution of problems

Cultural benefits
- Happier, more productive teams
- Higher employee engagement
- Greater professional development opportunities

Business benefits
- Faster delivery of features
- More stable operating environments
- Improved communication and collaboration
- More time to innovate (rather than fixing/maintaining)

In a non-DevOps environment, there can be tension between the two teams:
- Development team is measured on updates they deliver
- Operations team measured on health of system

Whereas in a DevOps environment, the entire team is responsible for delivering both new features and stability. Furthermore, the problems that arise tend to be less complex in nature because changes are made in smaller increments. The various tools used in a DevOps environment also allows the team to find problems earlier in the process.

### The Tools of DevOps

There are numerous tools that a DevOps team would use. These tools enable the team to have a shared codebase, allow for continuous integration and delivery, automated deployment, test-driven techniques, and many more.

**Git and GitHub**
- Distributed **S**ource **C**ode **M**anagement tool
- Allows to roll code back to a previous version when problems occur
- Allows for experimentation, branching to create new features and merging only when they're ready
